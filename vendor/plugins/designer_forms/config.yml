# This is the default DesignerForms configuration.
#
# The "common" section is loaded for all environments, but you can override any of the directives
# by adding an environment section like "test:", or "development:" and those values will be used
# instead.
# 
# You can also put ERB style code in here, such as <%= RAILS_ROOT %> and it'll be parsed.  If you
# want an empty string you can use '' -- but this should really be fixed in the plugin.
#
# NOTE: If you change these, you must restart the server.  If you want to change the configuration
#       directives per form instance, you can do so by accessing the DesignerFormsConfig object
#       with DesignerFormsConfig.form_class, or within the form block with
#       f.options.required_class.
